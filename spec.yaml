# This would just copy the files to the $datadir/filters folder
# question: how would a single url point to 2 files? Does the URL suppose to be the path to `xyz.py` instead then?
# should they copied to `xyz` and `abc`, i.e. no extension?
# May be situation like these should be splited into 2 formulae?
files: [xyz.py, abc.py]
keywords: [example, spec]
# may be for auto-gallery only. or may be also auto install these
# should version be controlled? Our goal is not replicating a full package manager...
install_requires: pantable
installer: pep # or cabal, etc. , this would run "pep install xyz" instead of copying files
